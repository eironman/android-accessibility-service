# Android Accessibility Service
This is a personal project for my mother.
I am developing a service that will allow her to use her phone and tablet with a controller
connected to the device. The controller will have a cross with four buttons (up, down, left, right),
and two other buttons, one to trigger a tap and other to trigger the back button.
The device will speak to help with the navigation. It's similar to the TalkBack service,
but this one will we less generic.
The idea is to tailor it to navigate specifically the apps that she will need.
